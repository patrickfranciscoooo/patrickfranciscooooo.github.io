        <p id="information">
        Hello, I am Patrick John A. Francisco. You can call me Patrick or Pat, any of the two will do.<br><br>

        My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 130 because I enjoyed it a lot last semester. Its topic was interesting
        because of the illustrations, diagrams and the program we used, Multimedia Logic, to better understand the lesson
        and answer the requirements about logic circuit, logic gates and the like.<br><br>

        My favorite GE so far is Ethics 1 because it challenges and hones my thinking and reasoning skills about a certain topic
        that is really timely. It will make you think if a specific decision to be made in a given situation is the one that you should
        do or the other way around in a way that you will weigh which is which.<br><br>

        My favorite programming subject so far is C programming because it has small difference with Python, which was the first one I learned,
        than R and Java in which I have to remember longer syntax, not so easy to find and solve the problems that I have encountered<br><br>
        and other things to consider.<br><br>

        My favorite food is Milktea. I really love Milktea most especially the ones with cream cheese or "cheesecake" in their flavor.
        It serves as my comfort food and a reward to myself for having a great day.
